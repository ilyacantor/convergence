Shared helpers for v2 route files — tenant_id and run_id resolution.

Every v2 endpoint that needs a tenant_id or run_id must use these helpers.
No hardcoded UUIDs anywhere in route handlers.

Resolution order:
1. Explicit query parameter (?tenant_id=...)
2. Active engagement from engagement_state table
3. Most recent active tenant from semantic_triples
4. HTTP 400 with actionable error message
