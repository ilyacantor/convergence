# FORKED from dcl/backend/core/db.py on 2026-03-29
# Changes from DCL original: POOL_MAX_CONN → CONVERGENCE_POOL_MAX_CONN, POOL_MIN_CONN → CONVERGENCE_POOL_MIN_CONN
# aos-common extraction planned post-carveout

"""
Shared Postgres connection pool for the DCL backend.

All modules that need a database connection should use this module
instead of creating their own pools. This keeps the total connection
count predictable (one pool per worker process).

Uses ThreadedConnectionPool for thread safety — uvicorn runs sync
endpoints in a threadpool, so multiple threads may borrow connections
concurrently. SimpleConnectionPool is NOT safe for this.

Usage:
    from backend.core.db import get_connection, close_pool

    with get_connection() as conn:
        with conn.cursor() as cur:
            cur.execute("SELECT ...")

    # get_connection() raises RuntimeError or PoolExhausted on failure —
    # it never returns None. Do not check `if conn is None`.
